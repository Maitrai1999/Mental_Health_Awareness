# Mental_Health_Awareness
Mental Health Awareness Project: A web app built using Angular (frontend) and Java with STS (backend) for promoting mental health. Features REST APIs with CRUD operations, MySQL for data handling, and Postman for testing. Includes entity, controller, service, and repo layers for scalability and modularity.

**Mental Health Awareness Project**

This project is a web-based application designed to promote mental health awareness by providing users with resources, tools, and access to experienced doctors. The application is built using a robust tech stack, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and a user-friendly experience.  

### **Technical Highlights**  

#### **Frontend**  
- Built using **Angular** and JavaScript, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface.  
- **Angular Commands Used:**  
  - Project creation: `ng new <project_name>`  
  - Component creation: `ng generate component <component_name>`  
  - Service creation: `ng g service <service_name>`  
  - Interface creation: `ng g interface <interface_name>`  
  - Running the application: `ng serve`  

#### **Backend**  
- Developed in **Spring Tool Suite (STS)** using Java and JPA/Hibernate for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).  
- Project structure follows the **JEE (Java Enterprise Edition)** model to handle large-scale applications.  
- Packages included:  
  - **Entity:** Defines the data model and maps Java classes to database tables.  
  - **Controller:** Handles HTTP requests and manages API endpoints.  
  - **Service:** Contains the business logic for application functionality.  
  - **Repository:** Provides database interaction through JPA for CRUD operations.  

#### **Database**  
- **MySQL** is used for persistent data storage, ensuring efficient data handling and querying.  
- The database schema is designed to support modular extensions, with primary keys and validations for data integrity.  

#### **API and Postman**  
- RESTful APIs are developed to enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend.  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented for managing patient and doctor records.  
- **Postman** was used for API testing, data entry, and mocking during development.  

### **Project Features**  
This repository contains the complete codebase, database schema, and API documentation. The project is designed to be scalable and extensible, with future scope for enhancements such as chatbots or advanced analytics. It effectively combines modern technologies to address mental health challenges while offering a user-friendly and inclusive platform.
